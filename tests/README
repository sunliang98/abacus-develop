--------------------------------------
 Purposes for this test directory is:
--------------------------------------
1,  cover most features of ABACUS
2,  autotest script to check if the version is correct.
    (reference result calculated by one core and saved in result.ref)
    (user can change NUMBEROFPROCESS value in integrate/general_info to test by multi cores)

 How to run tests
--------------------------------------

1. Modify the file '/integrate/general_info' and set appropriate parameters.
2. Set the appropriate 'abacus' in the Autotst.sh.
3. Enter each integrate test directory, try this script for autotests
../integrate/Autotest.sh
4. if you want to focus on No.xxx example, such as 101_PW_OU:
cd 101_PW_OU and then type
./../integrate/Single.sh $parameter
# you can choose $parameter among "" (empty), debug or ref
# 'ref': generate result.ref file (the answer you need)
