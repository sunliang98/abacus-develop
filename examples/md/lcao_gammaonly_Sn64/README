By setting `calculation` to be `md`, ABACUS currently provides several different MD evolution methods, which is specified by keyword `md_type` in the `INPUT` file:

  - -1: FIRE method
  - 0: velocity Verlet algorithm (default: NVE ensemble)
  - 1: Nose-Hoover style non-Hamiltonian equations of motion
  - 2: NVT ensemble with Langevin thermostat
  - 4: MSST method

When `md_type` is set to 0, `md_thermostat` is used to specify the thermostat based on the velocity Verlet algorithm.

  - nve: NVE ensemble
  - anderson: NVT ensemble with Anderson thermostat
  - berendsen: NVT ensemble with Berendsen thermostat
  - rescaling: NVT ensemble with velocity Rescaling method 1
  - rescale_v: NVT ensemble with velocity Rescaling method 2

When `md_type` is set to 1, `md_pmode` is used to specify the NVT or NPT ensemble based on the Nose-Hoover style non-Hamiltonian equations of motion.

  - none: NVT ensemble
  - iso: NPT ensemble with isotropic cetl fluctuations
  - aniso: NPT ensemble with anisotropic cetl fluctuations
  - tri: NPT ensemble with non-orthogonal (triclinic) simulation box

Note:
1) When doing md calculations, turn off `symmetry`.
2) If the output file is too large, the `out_level` option is suggested to be `m`.
3) If you are not similar with input parameters, please check in `docs/input-main.md`.
4) INPUT_$md_type represents the INPUT file corresponding to the specific MD type.
