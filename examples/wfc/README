These examples show how to output the wavefunction in G space.
For PW basis:
	- set 'out_wfc_pw' to '1'
The wave function is output in a file called 'WAVEFUNC1.txt'

For LCAO basis:
	- set 'out_wfc_lcao' to '1'
Several `WFC_NAO_K#.txt` files will be output in multi-k calculation and 
`WFC_NAO_GAMMA1.txt` in gamma-only calculation.


For the wave functions in Real Space:
	- set 'out_wfc_r' to '1'
The wave function is output in files OUT.${suffix}/wfc_realspace/wfc_realspace_$K_$B, 
where $K and $B is the index of k point and band respectively.
Note, it is only used in planewave basis and get_wf calculation in localized orbitals set
